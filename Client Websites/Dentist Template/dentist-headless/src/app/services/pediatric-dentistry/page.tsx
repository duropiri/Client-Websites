        "Similar to adults, your child should visit us for routine children's dentistry services, which include checkups and cleanings. These cleanings are most beneficial every six months.

Just like a dental cleaning for you, at Haimanot Trischuk Dental Clinic, we will remove damaging plaque and debris from your child's teeth. We always include an oral exam for your child to ensure their teeth are erupting properly. As your child grows older, we will also monitor their adult teeth to ensure they are coming in correctly.",

      title: "simple tips to help avoid tooth decay",
      content:
        "As a parent, you can take early preventative measures to protect your child against tooth decay, even before their first dental visit:\nMake an effort to rinse your baby's teeth with water or gently wipe them down with a damp cloth after feeding, especially before they fall asleep. Any residue from milk or formula can promote decay. Untreated cavities can cause discomfort and potentially lead to a harmful infection.\nAim to wean your child off breastfeeding or bottle-feeding by their first birthday. This effort helps prevent decay and reduces the risk of jaw growth problems resulting from excessive sucking.\nEstablish good habits from the start. Begin brushing their teeth as soon as the first tooth appears. Even the tiniest tooth can develop a cavity. Use a soft-bristled brush and water, and consult us about when to introduce a small amount of toothpaste.\nWhen your child is old enough to start brushing on their own, continue to supervise their brushing and assist them in cleaning any areas they might have missed.\nAvoid giving sugary drinks or milk before bedtime as part of proper dental care.\nLimit the consumption of sugary foods and drinks in your child's diet.",
